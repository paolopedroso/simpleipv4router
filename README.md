# simpleipv4router
This project implements a simple router for an LLM startup using Mininet and a POX controller. It creates a network topology with routing and firewall rules to manage traffic between subnets, trusted and untrusted hosts, and a server, enhancing security by controlling IP and ICMP traffic.
